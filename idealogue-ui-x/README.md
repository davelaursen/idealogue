# idealogue-ui-x

Experimental UI for Idealogue - uses AngularJS, JQuery, HTML5 and CSS3 to implement a 3D workflow using
parallax scrolling and other animations to make the user feel like they're interacting with different parts
of a multi-dimensional application rather than a single-framed window that constantly overwrites itself with
new views.

**CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT**
This is by nature an unstable application, as it's a place for me to experiment with different designs and
implementations. All testing is done only on Chrome, and there's a decent chance that it won't work properly
in some browsers.
