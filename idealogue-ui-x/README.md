# idealogue-ui-x

> Experimental UI for Idealogue - uses JQuery, AngularJS, HTML5 and CSS3 to implement a 3D workflow using
parallax scrolling and other animations to make the user feel like they're interacting with different parts
of a multi-dimensional application rather than a single-framed window that constantly overwrites itself with
new views.
