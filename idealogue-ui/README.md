# idealogue-ui

UI for Idealogue - uses AngularJS, JQuery, HTML5 and CSS3.

**CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT**
This is actively being developed at this time. I'm currently implementing base functionality.  The design is completely
CSS-driven - the HTML has no layout or style information.

_Completed_
* Idea section: happy path has been implemented, minus the ability to sort and filter the ideas list
* People section: happy path has been implemented, minus the ability to sort and filter the people list
* Account section: happy path has been implemented
* Authentication: happy path for login & user registration has been implemented

_In The Works_
* Sort and filter functionality for idea and people lists
* Search: happy path
* Administrator: add admin flag to users
* Authorization: can only edit/delete ideas for which you are a proposer (or if you're an admin)
* Import/Export: allow admins to import/export idea and user records
