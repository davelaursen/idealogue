#I\`deÂ´a\`logue
n. One given to fanciful ideas or theories

**Idealogue** is a system where ideas can be shared and voted on within a group or organization.
It provides a forum for people to share new product ideas, suggest process or tool improvements,
organize Hackathon teams and projects, share information and collaborate on side projects, and
otherwise give people a voice to improve their organization.

## Implementations
This project contains multiple implementations using different technologies. While it does provides
real-world value, this is essentially a training project for me and demonstrates how to implement
similar functionality across multiple tech stacks.

#### angular1-node-hapi-mongodb
This project uses the following technologies:

- Angular 1.5
- NodeJS 5.x
- Hapi 13.x
- MongoDB 3.x

It uses simple cookie-based authentication, and does not utilize a build system. To install and run,
follow these steps:

1. Install MongoDB and start it up.
2. Clone this repo and switch to the project directory: `cd idealogue/angular1-node-hapi-mongodb`
3. Run `npm install` and `bower install`.
4. Run the application: `node src/server/app.js`.
